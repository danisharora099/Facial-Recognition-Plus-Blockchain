Maximing Security Using Blokchain and ML

Security in the current era has been a rising issue for the whole general population. Everyone likes their property and assets safe and secure but regardless of this there are still damages done. Especially in school and college campuses where there are numerous unrestrained kids and teens. Thus to prevent or know the people responsible for the damage and destruction of university assets the project provides a solution to the above problem statement  

In a digital world like todayâ€™s, security and safety always come first. The problem of vandalism, theft, property damage exists in a lot of places, including school, college, and office buildings. To counter this, a lot of campuses are equipping themselves with CCTV cameras. However, this is still limiting as even if the face of the person responsible is captured, the problem of proper identification still exists. This is where we come in - we provide a platform that takes in a video clipping, scans for different faces within the video through Machine Learning algorithms using a database of faculty, students, etc which is stored on a Blockchain server to ensure reliability and credibility. It then processes and displays the people in the video responsible for what damage. This ensures that the data is not tampered with, and also that the person responsible is caught efficiently.
